Simple Excel application that reads and analyzes data from a Microsoft Access Database file.

This was my final assignment for my Windows Application Programming Course (CP212) at Wilfrid Laurier University.
Over the course of a few days, I was given a Microsoft Access Database file to work with and was instructed to
write a program that performs multiple functions and produces output, as well as takes unexpected or undesired
user inputs into account. The functions that this program performs are:
- Importing a valid Microsoft Access Database
- List courses from the database and display them to a worksheet
- Display course enrollment data for a course of the user's choosing
- Display class average data for all courses in a bar graph on both an Excel worksheet and Microsoft Word document
